# Requirements
  (Or at least the versions I used while coding it and I cannot guarantee compatibility otherwise)
  * Python 3.12
  * pandas 2.3.0
  * numpy 1.26.4
  * [smplotlib 1.0.0](https://github.com/AstroJacobLi/smplotlib)
    * Used to make the graphs look "old-school" (see the linked repository), so if this is not your cup of tea, feel free to remove it. No other changes in code are needed.

To install dependencies, you can use:
```
pip install 
```
